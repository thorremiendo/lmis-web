            <h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>One of the most exposed areas to rainfall-induced landslides is the BLISTT area of the Cordillera
                Administrative Region, which experienced nine out of ten of the country's greatest 24-hour rainfall
                totals during tropical cyclones.

                In order to address this issue, the MULAT-BLISTT program was conceived to collect, collate, and
                systematically organize available landslide data into a database, integrate available landslide data
                into a Geographic Information System (GIS), identify the influential factors of landslides, generate
                landslide susceptibility maps, identify rainfall patterns prior to landslide occurrence, document
                indigenous knowledge associated with landslides, and generate indicative rainfall thresholds for
                possible use in an early warning system.

                The MULAT-BLISTT, which stands for Modelling and Understanding Landslide Events in BLISTT (Baguio, La
                Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba, Tublay), is a research program funded by the DOST-PCIEERD. The program's
                objective is to increase disaster resilience in accordance with R.A. 10121, the "Philippine Disaster
                Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010," and the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goal.</p>
