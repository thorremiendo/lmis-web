      <hr class="line">
      <h5>Monitored by DOST-PCIEERD and funded by DOST.</h5>
      <p>The research program was designed to produce up-to-date, high resolution information on Rainfall-Induced
        Landslides (RIL) in order to lower and prevent risks and losses in lives, livelihoods, health, community assets,
        and environmental quality. It was also intended to provide information for policies for early warning, evacuation,
        and development planning. Its goals are to support disaster mitigation and to strengthen disaster resilience.
